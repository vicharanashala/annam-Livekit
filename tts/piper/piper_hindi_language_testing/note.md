Hugging face link - https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main/hi/hi_IN/priyamvada/medium

From here I download hi_IN-priyamvada-medium.onnx   and hi_IN-priyamvada-medium.onnx.json and upload both these inside colab then I run all the code from starting.(Code are there inside ipynb file)

This is how I run my Piper model for hindi language to generate speech output from text.I find that it is very fast to run also it is very easy to run.
