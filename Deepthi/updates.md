The new IndicF5 script shared by Shubankar was tested with different Malayalam voice samples to identify a native-sounding speaker. The sound2_female reference audio and its corresponding text were selected for further processing. The model performs well for short prompts; however, for longer prompts, the voice quality degrades and noticeable noise appears at the beginning of the generated audio.
